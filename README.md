## **Goals/Expectations**

2. Set an achieveable objective for the game. 30 second timer
3. Give visual feedback for user interaction. Red for unmatched cards, green for matched cards, and alerts for completion or game over

## Design

The website uses a basic colour pallete of orange, white, and black, that is bright and vibrant to keep user attention. The font is an imported font called Delicious Handrawn. The header is the reverse colours of the favicon, with the font colour of the rest of the text being black.
The initial layout was planned using a programme called balsamiq to create the wireframe. The end product was adapted over the course of creation, and then further changed after user feedback. You can find the wireframe here:

## Future Updates

* Add more cards to create a larger game board and increase the difficulty. 
* Create two modes that increase or decrease the difficulty. This will be achieved by creating two timers, 30 seconds and 60 seconds. The user will have the ability to select which timer they would like to use for the game play.

## Features
### **Header**
The header contains the name of the game. The text is large in line witht he colour palette, with a white background to make it stand out
### **Game**
The game area is white with a box shadow around each card. This gives the illusion of of raised elements. 
### **Moves**
The moves counter is in black to provide enough contrast from the bright orange background. The counter will go up when 2 cards are clicked to be assessed for matches
### **Timer**
